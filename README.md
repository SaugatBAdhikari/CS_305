Software Security Implementation for Artemis Financial
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for customers, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The company needed to modernize its operations by implementing current software security practices, specifically adding a file verification step to its web application using checksums to protect client data during transmission. I successfully addressed their security requirements by implementing multiple layers of protection: SHA-256 cryptographic hashing for data integrity verification, HTTPS/SSL encryption for secure communications, OWASP Dependency-Check for automated vulnerability scanning, and secure coding practices with proper error handling and input validation. Secure coding is critical for financial services companies because it protects sensitive client data, prevents breaches that could result in financial losses and reputational damage, ensures regulatory compliance, and builds customer confidence. Software security adds significant value to a company's overall well-being by providing a competitive advantage and demonstrating commitment to protecting client information.
The most helpful part of the vulnerability assessment was learning to use OWASP Dependency-Check for automated security scanning, which helped me understand the importance of regularly scanning third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities. The most challenging aspect was properly configuring SSL/HTTPS certificates and troubleshooting browser security warnings for self-signed certificates, though this helped me understand the difference between development and production security configurations. To ensure functionality and security after refactoring, I performed comprehensive testing including functional verification, security testing of the SHA-256 checksum and SSL/TLS handshake, manual code review, and dependency scanning. I checked for new vulnerabilities by running OWASP Dependency-Check, performing manual code review focusing on security best practices, and verifying that all security implementations worked correctly. For future employers, this assignment demonstrates my ability to implement industry-standard security practices, conduct vulnerability assessments, apply secure coding principles following OWASP guidelines, and document security implementations—all valuable skills in today's cybersecurity-focused job market.
